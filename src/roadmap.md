# Roadmap

## Low-Level


*  Have ELF (native Linux) code run inside ''/Volumes/SystemRoot''.

*  Extend the kernel module to produce Mach-O core dumps.

*  Enable macOS Homebrew to run (current hurdle: [missing memberd](https///github.com/darlinghq/darling/issues/353)).

*  Fix the [bug](https///github.com/darlinghq/darling/issues/368) with a single Mach port in multiple port sets.
